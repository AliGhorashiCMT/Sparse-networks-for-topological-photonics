# Sparse-networks-for-topological-photonics

This repository is associated with the preprint: [Interpretable Artificial Intelligence for Topological Photonics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10485) by Ghorashi, Vaidya, et al. (possibly with a slight name change). Here, you will find all necessary data to reproduce the results referenced there. All results are in the rectangular lattices folder.
